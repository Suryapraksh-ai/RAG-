# 🤖 PDF Question-Answering Chatbot using LangChain, Groq, and ChromaDB

This project demonstrates how to build a chatbot that can read, understand, and answer questions from a **PDF document** using state-of-the-art **LLMs** and **vector search**.

It uses:
- 🧠 **Groq LLaMA-3.1 70B** (blazing-fast LLM via Groq API)
- 🔍 **ChromaDB** for vector storage & semantic retrieval
- 🧱 **LangChain** to manage loading, splitting, embedding, and chaining
- 🧾 **HuggingFace Embeddings** to convert text into high-dimensional vectors

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📥 Load and process any PDF file
- 🧠 Use LLM to answer questions based on PDF content
- 🔍 Retrieve relevant chunks using semantic search
- 📎 See the source content that the model used to answer
